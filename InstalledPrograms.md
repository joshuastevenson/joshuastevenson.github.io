# Programs I use
Kinda organized. May have links to obscure things. Or all things?

---

### eclipse
My prefered ide. Started with it and I like it. I end up with many copies because I make a new copy for distinct plugins. Good for java, c/c++, ceylon. Poor for rust and python. I'm sad the adt plugin was dropped.

### jet brains 
android studio, pycharm, webstorm, ect. Webstorm is pretty nice. Pycharm is ok. Android Studio makes me sad. Haven't tried Clion. 

### visual studio
I dread needing to use it.

### visual studio code
Should not have vs in the name. The experience is so much better. Best markdown preview I've found. Much better than Atom is every way? Atom is trash.

### notepad++
For plain text, notes (new documents that never get saved or closed), quick viewing of any source file

### sublime text
Great for basic code editing

### rstudio
What else are you going to use with r?

### texstudio
On the off occasion I need/want letex

### gvim
Default program for xml files (they can be big)

---

### git for windows (git bash)
Default terminal. Git guis fail.

### cygwin
Fuller than git bash. It has unix python. Makes ipython better.

---

### 7zip
What else would you use?

### hexchat
On the rare occasion I need irc. No strong attachment to it. It was just the first free one I found and it works well enough.

### obs
Screen recording and streaming.

### paint[.]net
Simple image editor. `prt scr`, `ctrl v`, `s`, `drag selection`, `ctrl c`, paste to twitter, imgur, ect.

### gimp
Complicated, bloated beast I only use on rare necessities 


### firefox
My preferred browser. I like the ui. I prefer a separate search bar.

### chrome
Used for flash.

### steam
What else would I use?

### wiinusoft
Lets me use my Wii U Pro controller on Windows

### ffmpeg
Because an mp4 isn't just an mp4.

### rapidee
Clean enviroment variable editor. Was more important before windows 10 but still nice.

### openhardwaremonitor
How hot 's you're stack?

### pviewer
Better than windows 10 Photo app

### livesplit
A timer.

### wsplit
Older and simpler timer

### fiddler
I have never used this.

### Windows media player
Used for my music collection. Also random midis

### VLC
Used for weird stuff and videos.

### streamlink/livestreamer
Play online videos in VLC. Was more important when twitch needed flash but it still sometimes has problems.

Boring email client

---

### musescore
Bad but best free option. Say something about it on twitter and get a dumb response from support

### audacity
Ride dem waves

### anvilstudio
Ok midi editor. Not really good. Everything is bad actually.
