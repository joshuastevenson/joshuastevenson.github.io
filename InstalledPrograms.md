# Programs I use
Kinda organized. May have links to obscure things. Or all things? Googling it is probably always best. Links change.

---

### eclipse
My preferred ide. Started with it and I like it. I end up with many copies because I make a new copy for distinct plugins. Good for java, c/c++, ceylon. Poor for rust and python. I'm sad the adt plugin was dropped.

### jet brains 
android studio, pycharm, webstorm, ect. Webstorm is pretty nice. Pycharm is ok. Android Studio makes me sad. Haven't tried Clion. 

### visual studio
I dread needing to use it.

### visual studio code
Should not have vs in the name. The experience is so much better. Best markdown preview I've found. Much better than Atom is every way? Atom is trash.

### notepad++
For plain text, notes (new documents that never get saved or closed), quick viewing of any source file

### sublime text
Great for basic code editing

### rstudio
What else are you going to use with r?

### texstudio
On the off occasion I need/want letex

### gvim
Default program for xml files (they can be big)

--- 

### Languages 

* python
* java
* node/npm
* r
* rust
* MikTeX *(letex)

ruby, haskell, racket, and perl might be there somewhere. 

---

### git for windows (git bash)
Default terminal. Git guis fail.

### cygwin
Fuller than git bash. It has unix python. Makes ipython better.

---

### 7zip
What else would you use?

### rapidee
Clean environment variable editor. Was more important before windows 10 but still nice.

### openhardwaremonitor
How hot 's your stack?

### Virtualbox
Not 100% garbage

---

### firefox
My preferred browser. I like the ui. I prefer a separate search bar.

### chrome
Used for flash.

### thunderbird
Boring email client

### steam
What else would I use?

### hexchat
On the rare occasion I need irc. No strong attachment to it. It was just the first free one I found and it works well enough.

### obs
Screen recording and streaming.

### pviewer
Better than windows 10 Photo app. Still pretty bad.

### paint[.]net
Simple image editor. `prt scr`, `ctrl v`, `s`, `drag selection`, `ctrl c`, paste to twitter, imgur, ect.

### gimp
Complicated, bloated beast I only use on rare necessities 

### wiinusoft
Lets me use my Wii U Pro controller on Windows

### ffmpeg
Because an mp4 isn't just an mp4.

### livesplit
A timer.

### wsplit
Older and simpler timer

### fiddler
I have never used this.

### Windows media player
Used for my music collection. Also random midis

### VLC
Used for weird stuff and videos.

### streamlink/livestreamer
Play online videos in VLC. Was more important when twitch needed flash but it still sometimes has problems.

### musescore
Bad but best free option. Say something about it on twitter and get a dumb response from support

### audacity
Ride dem waves

### anvilstudio
Ok midi editor. Not really good. Everything is bad actually.
