I wrote a python script using some random script on github for myself. I wanted to share this but python scripts can't be consumed by most people. You gotta have a web app. So I went forward converting the code base to JavaScript.

Before I did anything I looked to see if there were anything that could make python code just work on the web. Research found no project still bearing fruit.

First step in the project was rewrite the random code in javascript. The random code depended on a python library so I had to find a javascript replacement. That wasn't too hard. Only minor googling was required. Download the js file, put it in the project directory, and add a script tag to the html.
