# What Makes a Computer Science degree?
I received a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from Wright State University.  Here I give some detail about each course I took. Note, I could count the number of lectures I've missed on my hands.

## Required Courses

### CS 1180 Computer Science I
I did not take this course. I had credit from the AP Computer Science exam I took in high school. I do not know exactly what is taught in it but I can guess. 

The course is an introductory programming course using java. Control structure {if, switch, while, for}, types, type literals (I helped someone with this once),classes, enums (I heard they are not fully explained), and ? (though I don't know if ternary `?` is covered). Swing apparently was introduced when I started but they switched to JavaFX. 

I am really glad I did not need to take this course. I am fairly sure I would have learned nothing given what I had taught myself from the internet. In fact...

### CS 1181 Computer Science II
The course after 1180. I learned nothing. Some of the content was still overlap from AP CS (Recursion) and other content (understanding how linked and array lists work, using queues and stacks) I had already studied myself. I'm not sure if inheritance was first introduced here or before. A few of the labs/projects required using existing code and project design. One of them was poorly designed enough that I had to annotate my code `@Depricated` that interfaced with code that couldn't be change. It was only even like 30 loc that were provided but it was just the wrong way of doing it. My instructor retired so I do not know if that assignment still exists. My memories of the class aren't helped by the instructor's quizzes being "What was the implementation of ___ in chapter X.x?" followed by a list of valid implementations, including those mentioned in other sections (knowledge of the book was needed, not the concepts). Positive note: the course taught how to actually profile java (using netbeans).

New things this course made me do: Draw out node chains.

### MTH 2570 Discrete Math
Basic predicate logic/boolean algebra. Basic graph theory and combinatorics. Proof by induction. 

### CS 1000 Technology in Society 
I TAed for this course. I *should* be able to explain it. Maybe later. It is taken as an elective (satisfying core requirements) by non CS students

Ethics, Intellectual Property, global implications, ect.

### CEG 2350 Operating Systems Concepts and Usage
The "If you're going to do programing, you're expected to just know this stuff" course. Also "How to google" and "Look! StackOverflow can be wrong".

Introduction to linux, bash, ssh, virtual machines, python, git, sockets. History of things. Lecturing straight off wikipedia.

I already knew most of the stuff but I had a good instructor and friends and had a good time there.

### CEG 3310 Computer Organization 
Basic computer architecture, gates, binary, hex, asm

### MTH 2310 Calculus II
Calc 2 is calc 2

### CS 3100 Data Structures and algorithms
Intro c++, array/linked lists, hashing, graphs

### EGR 3350 Technical Communication
ya best be able to speak n' write ya hear

### ISE 2210 Statistics for Engineers
A math department stats class was also an option. Basic probability, hypotheses testing. I learned more from AP Stats but the credit didn't meet the requirement.

### MTH 2530 Linear Algebra 
Matrix math.

### CEG 4110 Software Engineering

### CEG 4350 Operating System Internals and Design

### CEG 498[01] Team Projects / Senior Design

### CS 2210 Logic for Computer Scientists 



## CS Electives
