# I-Marked-It-Down
Blog like rambles informally published. I'll use whatever writing conventions I like so don't yell at me for punctuation usage or for not always capitalizing proper nouns. Also, "rambles". Multiple drafts are unlikely.

Look at the repository files list for a file listing (I'm not updating the read me when new documents are published).
