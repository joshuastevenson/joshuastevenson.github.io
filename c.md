# My C
My job is writing fast math widgets. The tool of the trade is C++ for better or worse. There are a lot of ways to write C++. A lot of them, from my experience, are high effort - low reward - low satisfaction. My style is similar to ["Orthodox"](https://gist.github.com/bkaradzic/2e39896bc7d8c34e042b#any-other-similar-ideas) C++ and the like. *Aka **not** "Modern C++*.

For reference, I support Centos/RHEL 7. This means GCC 4.8. It has some C++11 features and libraries, but some things like regex are worse than non existent. (`<regex>` exists, compiles, and does all of nothing.) Some of my code needs to support GCC 4.4 (RHEL 6) too, which makes me sad.
