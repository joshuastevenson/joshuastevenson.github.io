# Developers All Suck
An on going list of things I hate most about software.

## Desktop

### Only allowing one open instance
Example: Musescore

## Web

### Prioritizing sign up over log in.
Way too common. 

### Needing more horizontal space at minimum to display all content than needed.
I expect to see all the content with at most 960 pixels width (half of my 1080p laptop screen). Google gives me a scroll bar. 

## Mobile

### (web) Less than half of the screen is content
Have a banner. Have another. Have another. And and pop up ad. And another. Throw your phone at a wall.

## CLI

### A consistent form of parameters is hopeless
But using `-s --sort` style would be nice.
